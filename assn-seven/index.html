        <h2>Block Shot</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
               Kills the monsters will a weapon that blocks their movement. Score system is implemented. 
            </li>

            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                Created a lot of reusable function to avoid repetition.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                I learned a lot about Phaser's callback functions, local and global scopes, and some ways of creating the score system.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
                <ul>
                    <li>I created the weapon block but I borrowed the rest. I forgot the specific webpage although I know it's from this site: <a href="https://itch.io">Phaser logo</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you
                must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
                I guess game's that are maze-type games. I didn't really looked at any phaser examples, it just came to mind. It probably started from the first Analog Assignment I had that is basically also a maze game.
            </li>

            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                A maze game that speeds up the monsters as the level go up.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
                The theme for this game is all about speed and instensity. The more the player goes up a level, the harder it is to score points.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                  
                In terms of playstyle, the player can move to a certain location or place a block to block the enemies from killing the character. The randomness is applied in how many enemies respawn at a certain level.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
               Fast-thinking and stress-inducing
            </li>

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                Intense, rage, and frustration
            </li>

            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
               Players can move around the area where it's not blocked. The player can use block to either kill monster/s or use it to block them. There's only one goal in this game: reach the escape region without getting hit by the raging monsters. 
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                Play it calmly and use blocks wisely.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                None
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                Everyone
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                Indefinite
            </li>

        </ul>
