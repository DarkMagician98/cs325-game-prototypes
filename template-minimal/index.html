<h2>For the Meme</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
It is like who wants to be a millionaire but the players only guesses the answer through luck or using a powerup. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
I created an object variable that acts like enum for readability. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
I learned a lot about Javascript methods, although I didn't put much here(only localStorage). The hardest part of making this game was the mathetical equations needed to run the game. The easiest was probably creating the graphical assets. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I create my prototytpe from scratch except for the sound effects.

<li>Applause Sound Effect: <a href="https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/applause-10033/">link</a></li>
<li>Click and Bell Sound Effect:  <a href="https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/bells/">link</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Apparently, I've thought of 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' when I was working on this game, so, that.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
     'For the Meme' is a number-guessing game based on luck. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Probably
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
I used randomness to generate the secret number for each level. The genre should be casual game and the play style is playing it over and over again until the player gets a good chance to beat his/her high-score. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
 Number-guessing and solving
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
 I want the players to think of their answers and decisions while playing the game so they could get a good score. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The rules are simple:  On each level, pick a number within 0 to 100--use a powerup, if need be, to narrow down possible answers. Players can play the game several times, but it goes back to level 0 at every start. However, they cannot retain their scores after a game is over. Simultaneously guessing the correct number will open up a multiplier that doubles the player's score per level after the opening. The chances of getting a powerup also increase as the streak goes up. The player starts with three unique powerups--30% within, divisible by n, and even/odd. "30% within" is a powerup where players can narrow down the answer to 30% of the current guesses. "Divisible by n" is a powerup that tells the player whether the number is divisible by a certain number. The powerup only provides numbers within 0 to 10. For example, if the secret number is 64, then the powerup should return a sentence. An example would be: "The secret number is divisible by 8, 4, and 2." "Even/Odd" is just a low-tier powerup that tells the player whether the secret number is an even or an odd. 

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It is important to remember that this game is base on luck, and players can play it several times. If the player gets a streak right at the beginning level, it is a good idea to use a powerup during this time to increase the chances of guessing the answer and get a score multiplier by a certain amount for the streak.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
It is a dark world where people endowed with luck can easily reach the top. Blessings are provided to them by the divine providence as they go through life. However, not everyone is lucky. The world is in chaos; poverty and homelessness are all over the place. Some hope and dream of the day that will bring them great luck, some gave up and die, but some are brave enough to keep going and strive to move up the ladder. Living is hard, but that is life. People must understand that everyone starts somewhere, and with enough perseverance and patience, they will eventually reach their goal in life.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is for everyone to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Indefinite
