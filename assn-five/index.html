        <h2>Ninja Clicker</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
                The more the player clicks the wrong object, the more chances that the new object will spawn the 'heart' object, which is the ones the player shouldn't click.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                Created a reusable function to avoid repetition.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                I learned a lot about Phaser's tween class and how to switch between scenes. Now I'm wondering how many scenes are use on games I play.
                Learning how to balance the mechanics of the game. 
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
                <ul>
                    <li>I borrowed them but I forgot the specific webpage. Although I know it's from this site: <a href="https://itch.io">Phaser logo</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you
                must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
            </li>

            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                A clicking-game where your chances of winning lessens the more you click the wrong object. 
            </li>

            <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
                I used the 'fame' theme. I just thought the more famous a person is, then the more followers he/she get. In this game's perspective,
                the more the player clicks the same object, the more chance the game will generate that object.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                In terms of playstyle, it would be just players clicking on the right object to win. In terms of randomness, it would be based on chances.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
               Fast-clicking
            </li>

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                Intense
            </li>

            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
               Players can click on the objects that moves around the screen--click the right ones and win, click the wrong ones and lose. 
               The game generate a new object each time the player clicks on an object. The more the player 
               clicks on the wrong ones, the less the right object generates.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                Play it over and over.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                None
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                Everyone
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                30 seconds per game
            </li>

        </ul>
