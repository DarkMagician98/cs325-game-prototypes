    <h2>For the Meme</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            What is original about your game?
            The game is unique on its own form. Defending against the incoming carrots to save himself from eating too
            much and growing bigger and bigger the more he eats is what I think what makes this game original.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            What is interesting about your game technology?
            I made use of the delta time and the time class from Phaser to make sure the carrots are moving at a fixed
            time per wave. The waves acceleration time also increases the more waves passes.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            What did you learn from this prototype?
            What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
            I learned a lot about Phaser's group system by browsing around PhotonStorm. I actually began to understand
            how the documentation works, so I feel much at ease when I ran into a problem because
            I could easily just look it up there.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
            No, but I forgot where I got the assets.

        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
          I don't really have any games in mind but I think it's a general mechanic type of a game where developer can use on a boss-level scene or maybe when a player is trap around an area.
        </li>

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            Carrot defender is a game where players avoid carrots.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
            The theme for this game was 'bodyguard.' I was originally thinking about developing a tower defense game but I could not do it, so I came with this instead. The game has an idea of bodyguarding the player itself from eating more carrots or else the character will die and it's all over.
            
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
            I used randomness to generate which side of the map the horde of carrots will spawn. The inputs are simple: press 'space' to dash and arrow keys for movements. The play style is to simple avoid the carrots as much as possible and don't get too greedy gathering extra points by picking up grass.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
             Speed and patience
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
            I want players to be attentive and be quick if they are trying to pick up the grass which gives extra points. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            The gameplay is quite simple: avoid the carrots, pick up the grass if possible, and make sure to pay attention on the incoming wave of carrots. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            There's two strategy I can think of to get a high for this game. First, be patient when picking up grass and be quick dashing away from the carrots. Second, dash quickly and pick up the grass as much as the player wants.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
            The world is rich and food is everywhere. Anyone can eat anything and everyone is allowed to each as much as they want. However, Bunny, is afraid he is getting too big and he starting to feel very concious of himself.
            His awareness of himself made him realize how much food he's got everywhere and now he is trying to keep himself away from it. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            This game is for everyone to play.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            Indefinite
        </li>
